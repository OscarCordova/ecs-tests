# MTax Validation Refactor

Given a `MTax.java` class with a `validate` method, how would you...

- Refactor the code to be both more legible and optimized
- Make the necessary adjustments in a [Github PR](https://github.com/ecaresoft/ecs-tests/blob/master/doc/PRs.md)
- Explain the improvements and justify the decisions you made

Extra points:

- Nice and ordered [semantic commits](https://github.com/ecaresoft/ecs-tests/blob/master/doc/commits.md)
- Unit tests (when applicable, use JUnit)

Notes:

Support class: `XTax.java`
